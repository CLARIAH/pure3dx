<p>Pure3D is an app for authoring and publishing 3D editions.
It is the outcome of the
<a href="https://pure3d.eu/" target="_blank">Pure3D project</a>
led by
<a href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/cp-papadopoulos" target="_blank">Costas Papadopoulos</a>
at Maastricht University, Netherlands.
</p>
<p>The Maastricht University project team
consists of
Susan Schreibman (Co-PI),
Kelly Gillikin Schoueri (PhD Researcher),
Alicia Walsh (Research Assistant),
and Sohini Mallick (Research Software Engineer).
</p>
<p>
Projects partners include the
4DRLab at the University of Amsterdam,
The KNAW Humanities Cluster - Digital Infrastructure,
and
Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS).
</p>
<p>
Pilot projects through which user requirements have
been developed are contributed by
4DRLab,
Erfgoed Leiden en Omstreken,
Gemeente Maastricht,
Museum van Bommel van Dam,
and
Nederlands Mijnmuseum.

<p>
<a href="https://editions.pure3d.eu/">Pure3D</a>
is hosted on
<a href="https://www.clariah.nl/" target="_blank">CLARIAH</a>
infrastructure, managed from
<a href="https://di.huc.knaw.nl/home-en.html" target="_blank">KNAW/HuC</a>.
</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/CLARIAH/pure3dx" target="_blank">software code</a>
of Pure3D is the product of
Bas Doppen (the design of the editions part of the Pure3D app),
Dirk Roorda (the backend and the overall architecture),
with thanks to Qiqing Ding (Vic) for lots of input on the containerization and
Kubernetes deployment.
Pure3D contains several releases of the
<a href="https://github.com/Smithsonian/dpo-voyager" target="_blank">Smithsonian Voyager</a>,
whose main developer is Jamie Cope.
</p>
<p>
  PURE3D is a three-year project funded by the
  <a
    href="https://pdi-ssh.nl/nl/home/"
  >PDI-SSH (Platform Digitale Infrastructuur - Social Sciences and Humanities)</a>
  with a mission to advance the virtual research environment through the development
  of an access infrastructure for viewing interactive Digital Heritage and Digital
  Humanities 3D content online. The platform intends to target the unique needs
  and abilities of both the content creators (researchers, educators, cultural
  heritage managers) as well as the end-users (students, public, academics,
  etc.).
</p>
<p>
  Building on the conventions of text-based digital scholarly
  editions, PURE3D will provide tools to integrate multiple types of source
  materials (e.g., annotations, images, video, structured/unstructured data)
  and document the creation process (paradata), providing users with direct
  access to the modelling and interpretative choices creating a multimodal resource
  impossible to replicate in print form.
</p>
<p>
  PURE3D is aware of the issues that research-based 3D content creators may
  encounter in making their projects and data accessible on the web. File size,
  format, technical know-how and funding are some of the issues. The PURE3D
  platform will act as a publication infrastructure for 3D editions, developing a
  conceptual and methodological framework for valorizing and evaluating 3D
  scholarship, so that 3D outputs can meaningfully contribute to the academic ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
  The PURE3D Project is based out of the
  <a
    href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/faculty-arts-and-social-sciences"
  >Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences</a>
  at
  <a href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/"
  >Maastricht University</a>
  under the direction of
  <a
    href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/k.papadopoulos">Dr. Costas Papadopoulos</a>
  and Prof. Susan Schreibman.
  A number of partner institutions join PURE3D as pilot projects or in advisory
  roles and technical support.
</p>
<p>
  This platform is in a beta-phase of production and is currently only
  displaying a selection of 3D editions developed by project partners in the
  last year. As such, it is not yet possible to build and publish your own 3D
  project at this time. Please follow us on social media as development on the
  platform continues. For more information about the Project with news and
  event updates, please visit
