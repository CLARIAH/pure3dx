        <p>Contested Memories is a long-term research project investigating the Battle of Mount Street Bridge through new technologies. The battle was the first confrontation on Wednesday 26 April 1916 between the Irish Volunteers and the British troops sent to quell the Irish Easter Rising. The 3D editions developed as part of the project each tell the story of the battle from a different perspective, focusing on key buildings and combatants.</p>
