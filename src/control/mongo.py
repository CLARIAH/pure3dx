        """CRUD interface to content in the MongoDb database.

        This class has methods to connect to a MongoDb database,
        to query its data, to create, update and delete data.

        It is instantiated by a singleton object.

        !!! note "string versus ObjectId"
            Some functions execute MongoDb statements, based on parameters
            whose values are MongoDb identifiers.
            These should be objects in the class `bson.objectid.ObjectId`.
            However, in many cases these ids enter the app as strings.

            In this module, such strings will be cast to proper ObjectIds,
            provided they are recognizable as values in a field whose name is
            `_id` or ends with `Id`.

        !!! note "Deletion policy"
            When a user deletes records, they will not be deleted, but instead they
            get `markedDeleted: true`. A cronjob will physically remove deleted
            records after 31 days.
            Also, deleted records will be listed on the admin interface. Admins can
            restore them within 30 days.

            Most methods that access the database know this policies. So if a
            list of records satisfying some criteria is asked, no records that
            are marked for deletion are returned.
            In other words: such records are treated as if they do not exist.

            Some methods do not implement this policy:

            *   `_execute()`
            *   `hardDelete...()`
            *   `mkBackup()`
            *   `restoreBackup()`

            Marking is done by adding `markedDeleted: true` to a record.
            Unmarking is done by removing the key `markedDeleted` from a record.

            So the test whether a record `r` is marked for deletion is:

            `r.get("markedDeleted", None)`

            And the mongo query expression to find unmarked records only is:

            `{markedDeleted: null}`
