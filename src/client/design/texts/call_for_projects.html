<p>
  It is not yet possible to build and publish 3D scholarly editions
  through the platform. However, this feature will be tested through a series
  of new projects that will be developed in PURE3D.  If you are a 3D content creator
  or 3D object/space holder and you are interested in working with the PURE3D
  infrastructure, you can apply for developing your project into a 3D scholarly
  edition. Successful applicants will receive support, guidance, and funding by
  the PURE3D team during the Fall of 2023. For more information about the Call
  and to make an application, please visit
