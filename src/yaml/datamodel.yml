        ## <a name="home">What is PURE3D?</a>

        PURE3D is a national infrastructure dedicated to the publication and
        preservation of 3D scholarship, spearheaded by Dr. Costas Papadopoulos
        and Prof. Susan Schreibman at Maastricht University, The Netherlands.
        The project aims to redefine how 3D cultural heritage and scholarly
        outputs are presented, preserved, and evaluated, fostering innovation
        in 3D-based research across the humanities and social sciences. Unlike
        traditional practices where 3D models are often detached from scholarly
        narratives, PURE3D integrates these models as primary scholarly
        outputs. By contextualising them with annotations, multimedia content,
        and metadata, PURE3D transforms them into multimodal resources that are
        impossible to replicate in print. This approach not only enhances
        accessibility but also ensures that both the models and their
        interpretative processes become part of the academic record.

        Phase 1 (2020–2024): Funded by the Platform Digitale Infrastructuur –
        Social Sciences & Humanities (PDI-SSH), this phase focused on
        developing the foundational infrastructure through pilot projects.
        These pilots informed user requirements and helped build a
        collaborative community of researchers to co-develop, test, and use the
        platform. Supported by NWO's Open Science Fund, a follow-up project,
        OPER3D (2024), explores workflows for peer review and evaluation of 3D
        scholarly editions, transforming PURE3D into a robust publication
        infrastructure.

        Future Developments (2025-2028): Funding from the Lorentz
        Centre/eScience Center will allow the project team to investigate the
        concept of paradata—the documentation of decision-making processes in
        creating 3D models—and its application within PURE3D. This also
        includes bringing together a group of 25 scholars for a workshop hosted
        at the Lorentz Centre in September 2025. Additional support from the
        eScience Centre throuhg the Open eScience Call will also enable the
        infrastructure to integrate advanced analytical tools to enhance the
        scholarly potential of 3D Scholarly Editions.

        To learn more about PURE3D’s mission and ongoing developments, visit
        the [PURE3D website](https://pure3d.eu/).

        ## <a name="projects">What is a PURE3D Project?</a> 

        A 3D model can be turned into a 3D Scholarly Edition. However, a
        project may have more than a single edition. Therefore, PURE3D allows
        authors to develop a series of editions group together under a thematic
        project. For example, our project 'Let there be light' developed by the
        Netherlands Mijnmusem consists of several 3D Scholarly editions of
        mining lamps. This allows for better categorisation and retrieval of
        editions and can provide better search options in the future.  

        ## <a name="editions">What is a 3D Scholarly Edition?</a>

        A 3D Scholarly Edition is an innovative form of digital publication
        where 3D models serve as the primary "text", accompanied by rich
        contextual, interpretative, and process-oriented information. Unlike
        traditional scholarly outputs that separate 3D models from their
        corresponding research narratives, 3DSEs integrate these elements into
        a unified, interactive environment designed to enhance scholarly
        communication and knowledge production.

        ## <a name="edition">Publish a 3D Scholarly Edition</a>

        Are you interested in turning your 3D model into a peer-reviewed 3D
        scholarly edition. You can find instructions for authors, submission
        guidelines and evaluation criteria, and examples of already published
        3D Scholarly Editions on the [PURE3D website](https://pure3d.eu/) under
        'Publish with Us'.
